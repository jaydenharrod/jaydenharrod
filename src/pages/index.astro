				I'm an Australian technologist with strong foundations in web development, infrastructure, operations, and product-led growth. 
				<br />
				<br />
				I've been scaling brands, technologies, products, and teams for {yearsOfExperience} years and I have had the privilege of working with some of Australia's most innovative startups and scaleups; including ASX:HPG hipages, ASX:BET BetMakers, ASX:CHL Camplify, ASX:NIB nib, Covidence, Digivizer, and Allie Clinics. And global companies such as Microsoft, Intel, and Lenovo.
				<br />
				<br />
				I have a unique blend of skills to own end-to-end technology operations. Spanning software engineering, infrastructure, product management, and team leadership. I've always seen programming as a tool to solve business problems and create scalable value, and I thrive in environments where systems are vital to success.
				<br />
				<br />
				Some of my roles have included Software Engineer, Technical Lead, Engineering Manager, Head of Engineering, and Product Manager.
