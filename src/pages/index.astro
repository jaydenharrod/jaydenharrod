        I'm a technical operator who's helped scale multiple product companies
        to $50M+ ARR â€” from the ground up. I've led during moments of chaos,
        M&A, and rapid growth to deliver meaningful outcomes across engineering,
        infrastructure, teams, and compliance.
        <br />
        <br />
         My roles have included Designer, Software Engineer, Technical Lead,
        Engineering Manager, Product Manager, and Head of Engineering.
